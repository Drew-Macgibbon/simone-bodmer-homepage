I wanted to do more, but I'm currently in the middle of nowhere, using phone for hotspot and a tempermental laptop that's driving me insane!

#### I have ideas!
(Some of them probably aren't that good ðŸ˜‚)

- SEO/Pagespeed:
  - Images:
    - They could be cropped better, lots of empty pixels in the PNG files
    - Definitely need to be optimized
    - Could either manually optimize or;
    - Use an automated servie like Cloudinary, or;
    - Something like Nuxt/Image to optimize on client side.
  - Javascript can be extracted to webworker to free up the main thread, this will improve pageload
  - Since the pages don't require a lot of user input, we can leverage Static Site Generate (pre-rendering the pages)
- UX:
  - The hero section could do a better job explaining what the business is about. The footer video might be better placed in the hero.
  - Images overflow the viewport height/width. Only having half a sculpture in view doesn't seem optimal to me.
- To-update:
  - "TAKE PART IN FEB 10 - APRIL 1, 2022 Solo debut of sculpture..." needs to be updated
- Business:
  - The homepage should showcase the artist more.
  - Why do I care about the sculptures (on homepage), maybe one sentace per peice,
  - Showcase some media coverage, competitions etc.
  - Have a clear call to action at the bottom of page, possibly an email signup box.
    - Could use some color here, would stand out greatly since the rest of the page is dull

Generally I have a good eye for detail, so as I get going I'll definitely add more to the list.

let me know what you think!
